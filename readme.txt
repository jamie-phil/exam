This is a small exam helper.

Before you use it, you need to get at least ONE [paper].pdf exported from the exam system.

And then, do the steps following:
1 make a directory, such like named '/lib';
2 put the pdf(s) into this directory;
3 add the corrigenda into err.txt and copy it to /lib;
4 open this project to modify the directory path in Exam.java;
5 build and run this project.

After its initialization, you can input the keyword to search questions.

Good luck and enjoy your exam!
